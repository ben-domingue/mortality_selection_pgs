this is prompted by george's comments and is going to focus on just those who live until 2006.

I find it very unhelpful to compound two very different selection issues, mortality and participation.  Mortality selection is natural selection.  Participation is a choice.  There is no a priori reason to believe that these two completely different mechanisms select on the same things.  There should be interest in understanding them separately.  So I would suggest looking at these two things separately.  They also have very different implications for survey "reputation."  If mortality selection changes estimated genotype-phenotype relationships that is a statement about nature and affects any genetic analysis on living people.   If providing a sample to HRS (and clearing QC) changes estimated genotype-phenotype relationships that is a problem for HRS in the sense that we have not done a good job of capturing the true relationship conditional on survival to the time we asked for it.  In terms of weights, it is completely consistent with other weights HRS provides to construct weights that correct for differential participation.  (Indeed, I'd want us to make such weights available for DNA). Weights that correct for survival from baseline to DNA collection are a novel concept.
